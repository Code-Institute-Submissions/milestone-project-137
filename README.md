## Lego Memory Game

This project is a summary of study from the fourth and fifth module of the Full Stack Developer Course - JavaScript Fundamentals & Interactive Frontend Development, to build a custom, mobile-first, fully responsive Vanilla JavaScript memory game.

The purpose of the game is to improve memory skills. Players can race against the countdown timer and keep track of their scores to see how well their memory skills are improving. The game is short and mobile-friendly so it's ideal for playing on your commute or for short brain training sessions during the day. This game would be the first in a range of memory games and games for language learning.

This project uses HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript to make the individual features of the game work. The above three programming languages were used in conjunction with the Bootstrap Framework to ensure the project itself is as responsive as possible for use amongst the current everyday screen device sizes such as, Mobile, Tablet and Laptop.
