## Lego Memory Game

This project is a summary of study from the fourth and fifth module of the Full Stack Developer Course - JavaScript Fundamentals & Interactive Frontend Development, to build a custom, mobile-first, fully responsive Vanilla JavaScript memory game.

The purpose of the game is to improve memory skills. Players can race against the countdown timer and keep track of their scores to see how well their memory skills are improving. The game is short and mobile-friendly so it's ideal for playing on your commute or for short brain training sessions during the day. This game would be the first in a range of memory games and games for language learning.
