## Lego Memory Game

This project is a summary of study from the fourth and fifth module of the Full Stack Developer Course - JavaScript Fundamentals & Interactive Frontend Development, to build a custom, mobile-first, fully responsive Vanilla JavaScript memory game.

The purpose of the game is to improve memory skills. Players can race against the countdown timer and keep track of their scores to see how well their memory skills are improving. The game is short and mobile-friendly so it's ideal for playing on your commute or for short brain training sessions during the day. This game would be the first in a range of memory games and games for language learning.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Construction üë∑

This project uses HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript to make the individual features of the game work. The above three programming languages were used in conjunction with the Bootstrap Framework to ensure the project itself is as responsive as possible for use amongst the current everyday screen device sizes such as, Mobile, Tablet and Laptop.

### Design:

#### Colour Scheme:

4 primary colours are used which are the main Lego colours:
- ![#ffd500 sample](assets/readmeimages/yellow.png) #ffd500 used as a background for main menu section.
- ![#008adb sample](assets/readmeimages/blue.png) #008adb used as a background for modals and buttons in main menu section.
- ![#e3000b sample](assets/readmeimages/red.png) #e3000b used as a background for main play button in main menu section.
- ![#43b02a sample](assets/readmeimages/green.png) #43b02a used as a background for cards.

All colours were used to style various elements in application.

#### Typography:

The "Goldman" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall back font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.
The "Roboto Mono" font is the font used in main arena section to prevent "jumping" text while numbers are changing.

Both fonts are attractive and appropriate.

#### Content Structure:

The main game geometry of the game is square, it refers in this way to Lego bricks. The game base on two sections and modals. All modals are square and have blue backgrounds. It is very easy solution to make sure all will be good visible on mobile devices.

#### Images:

The main image in main menu section is Emmet which is well know character from Lego movie. It will focus attention around younger and also older players.

  <p id="future"></p>

### Future features:

- Live Play - I'd like to add functionality to allow users to interact and compete with friends or other players with features like a real-time scoreboard and the option to send invites and challenges to other players.
- Variation of Themes - The current theme of the site is geared more towards children than adults, so I'd like create multiple themes so that users can select a theme when they first arrive on the site and their preference would be saved for the next time they visit.

<p id="testing"></p>

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing üî•

<p id="manualtesting"></p>

### Manual Testing:

Only manual testing method was used to test this project due to big gap of knowledge on how to use automatic testing tools like Jasmine or Enzyme yet. All functions were tested by myself by creating different scenarios.

Testing and improving the application was carried out throughout its development. The main testing tool was Google Chrome dev tools and devices such as a phone, tablet and laptop with several versions of browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera).

Passing the HTML file content through the W3C Validator for HTML resulted in no errors but one warning "Section lacks heading" which was game arena section but this is intentional so I ignored. The Bootstrap framework was tested extensively to ensure that the Mobile first Responsive Approach was achieved with this project. The Application was tested on my Lenovo Thinkbook laptop and large Samsung TV screen, Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile and Lenovo tablet. The application worked fine on all devices. If something didn't work as it should during the test it was immediately checked and corrected in DevTools and then implemented into the code and checked again. If test passed it was committed and pushed into repository. 

I used JSHint to validate JavaScript file configured to accept jQuery & ES6 features like const and let variables. There was no major warnings but this test allowed me to see where I had missing semi-colons from block of code and detect unused variables.

The project contains as much vanilla JavaScript as possible to allow the developer to understand the language appropriately. jQuery was used in total of four times to target the modal elements to show/hide.

CSS file content was regularly checked in the W3C Validator for CSS to ensure any errors were spotted throughout the development of the style sheet. As with the HTML validation if any errors were present they were checked in DevTools and then copy and pasted over to the code before committing and pushing the updated code to my GitHub Repository.

 ### User Stories:

 Here are the steps and results from the testing carried based on the project user stories to determine that the game and functionality are fit for purpose:
 1. As a player, I want to play a game that involves using my memory so that I can improve my memory skills.

  - Open <a href="https://zokam1411.github.io/milestone-project-2/">Lego memory game.</a>
  - Click "Highscores" button.
  - Best 5 scores for each level will be displayed.

Result: Game works as it should. All scores are grouped in correct level tables.

6. As a player, I want a fun game that will attract my kids to play and help with their memory skills.
- Open <a href="https://zokam1411.github.io/milestone-project-2/">Lego memory game.</a>
