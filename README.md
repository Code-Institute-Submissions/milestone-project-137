## Lego Memory Game

This project is a summary of study from the fourth and fifth module of the Full Stack Developer Course - JavaScript Fundamentals & Interactive Frontend Development, to build a custom, mobile-first, fully responsive Vanilla JavaScript memory game.

The purpose of the game is to improve memory skills. Players can race against the countdown timer and keep track of their scores to see how well their memory skills are improving. The game is short and mobile-friendly so it's ideal for playing on your commute or for short brain training sessions during the day. This game would be the first in a range of memory games and games for language learning.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Construction üë∑

This project uses HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript to make the individual features of the game work. The above three programming languages were used in conjunction with the Bootstrap Framework to ensure the project itself is as responsive as possible for use amongst the current everyday screen device sizes such as, Mobile, Tablet and Laptop.

4 primary colours are used which are the main Lego colours:

- ![#008adb sample](assets/readmeimages/blue.png) #008adb used as a background for modals and buttons in main menu section.
- ![#e3000b sample](assets/readmeimages/red.png) #e3000b used as a background for main play button in main menu section.
- ![#43b02a sample](assets/readmeimages/green.png) #43b02a used as a background for cards.

All colours were used to style various elements in application.

#### Typography:
The "Goldman" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall back font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.
The "Roboto Mono" font is the font used in main arena section to prevent "jumping" text while numbers are changing.

Both fonts are attractive and appropriate.
